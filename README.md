## Learn Node

![CI](https://github.com/palashmon/learn-node-pm/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

These are the starter files to accompany the [LearnNode.com](https://learnnode.com/) course. I keep updating this repo on regular basis after thoroughly understanding, practicing & re-learning each module in this course.

## Sample Data

To load sample data, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run sample
```

If you have previously loaded in this data, you can wipe your database 100% clean with:

```bash
npm run blowitallaway
```

That will populate 16 stores with 3 authors and 41 reviews. The logins for the authors are as follows:

|Name|Email (login)|Password|
|---|---|---|
|Wes Bos|wes@example.com|wes|
|Debbie Downer|debbie@example.com|debbie|
|Beau|beau@example.com|beau|
